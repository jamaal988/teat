    <h1>1=what is function? </h1>
    <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called</p>
    <h1>2=what is meant by the phrase divide and conquer ?</h1>
    <p>Divide-and-conquer solves a large problem by recursively breaking it down into smaller subproblems until they can be solved directly</p>
    <h1>3=how do functions help you reuse code in aprogram?</h1>
    <p>Functions help you reuse code in a program because the function can be written once to perform an operation, and then be executed any time it is needed</p>
    <h1>4=how can function make the development of multiple programs faster ?</h1>
    <p>Functions can be written for the commonly needed tasks, and those functions can be incorporated into each program that needs them</p>
    <h1>5=how can function make it easier for programs to be developed by team of programs?</h1>
    <p>When a program is developed as a set of functions in which each performs an
        individual task, then different programmers can be assigned the job of writing
        different functions</p>
    <h1>6=A function definition has what two parts?</h1>
    <p><ol>
        <li>A function definition has two parts: a header and a block. The header indicates</li>
        <li>the starting point of the function, and the block is a list of statements that
            belong to the function.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h1>7=What does the phrase "calling a function" mean?</h1>
    <p>To call a function means to execute the function</p>
    <h1>8=When a function is executing, what happens when the end of the function's block
        is reached?</h1>
    <p>When the end of the function is reached, the computer returns back to the
        part of the program that called the function, and the program resumes
        execution at that point</p>
    <h1>9=Why must you indent the statements in a block?</h1>
    <p>Because the Python interpreter uses the indentation to determine where a
        block begins and ends</p>
    <h1>10=What is a local variable? How is access to a local variable restricted?</h1>
    <p>A local variable is a variable that is declared inside a function. It belongs to
        the function in which it is declared, and only statements in the same function
        can access it.</p>
    <h1>11=What is a variable's scope?</h1>
    <p>The part of a program in which a variable may be accessed</p>
    <h1>12=Is it permissible for a local variable in one function to have the same name as a
        local variable in a different function?</h1>
    <p>yes, it is permissible</p>
    <h1>13=What are the pieces of data that are passed into a function called?</h1>
    <p>the pieces of data that are paassed into a function called argumants</p>
    <h1>14=What are the variables that receive pieces of data in a function called?</h1>
    <p>the variables that are receive pieces of data in a function called parameters </p>
    <h1>15=What is a parameter variable's scope?</h1>
    <p>A parameter variable's scope is the entire function in which the parameter is
        declared.</p>
    <h1>16=When a parameter is changed, does this affect the argument that was passed into
        the parameter?</h1>
    <p>no,it does not .</p>
    <h1>17=The following statements call a function named show_data . Which of the
       <br> statements passes arguments by position, and which passes keyword arguments?
       <br> a. show_data(name = 'Kathryn', age = 25)
       <br> b. show_data('Kathryn', 25)</h1>
<br>
      <b style="font-size: 160%;"> answer</b>
    <p>a. passes by keyword argument
      <br>  b. passes by position</p>
    <h1>18=What is the scope of a global variable?</h1>
    <p>The entire program</p>
    <h1>19=Give one good reason that you should not use global variables in a program</h1>
    <p> <b> Here are three:</b> <br>
        • Global variables make debugging difficult. Any statement in a program
     <br>   can change the value of a global variable. If you find that the wrong value
   <br>     is being stored in a global variable, you have to track down every statement
      <br>  that accesses it to determine where the bad value is coming from. In a
       <br> program with thousands of lines of code, this can be difficult.
       <br>
       <br> • Functions that use global variables are usually dependent on those variables.
       <br> If you want to use such a function in a different program, you will most
        likely have to redesign it so it does not rely on the global variable.
     <br>  <br> • Global variables make a program hard to understand. A global variable
      <br>  can be modified by any statement in the program. If you are to understand
      <br>  any part of the program that uses a global variable, you have to be aware
      <br>  of all the other parts of the program that access the global variable.
        </p>
    <h1>20=What is a global constant? Is it permissible to use global constants in a program?</h1>
    <p>A global constant is a name that is available to every function in the program.
      <br>  It is permissible to use global constants. <br> Because their value cannot be
        changed during the program's execution, <br> you do not have to worry about
        its value being altered.</p>
